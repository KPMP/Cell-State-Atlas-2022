# Visium Codebase

The included files are for reproducing the analysis and figures generated in the manuscript. The figures in the text consist of deconvolution of cell types and cell states in a Reference Nephrectomy and a CKD biopsy, and feature plots of specific cell types or states transfer scores and gene expressions. The code attached allows the user to change the object, cell types or cell states, and genes to be plotted. Instructions to create the desired image are included within the code.
